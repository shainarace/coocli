<p>We’ll start by examining what proportion of respondents had <em>anything</em> to say about law enforcement. All of the interactions reported in the survey were negative (the survey did not ask about positive interactions). To test for differences in law enforcement interactions across different rurality scores, we considered a chi-square test on the binary attribute <code>lawSumgt0 = lawSum&gt;0</code>, which takes a value of 1 if that respondent made <em>any</em> complaint and a 0 if they made <em>no</em> complaints. For many reasons this is a good measurement of <em>breadth</em> of a problem with law enforcement (a number not influenced by a “few excessive complainers”).</p>

<p>However, the first row of the second table below, which tests for a linear relationship, compels us to explore further - as there does appear to be some linear relationship between prevalence of law enforcement complaints and rurality. However, as we will see in the next section, that relationship disappears after the removal of a few key questions in Haywood county.</p>
<p>Diving Deeper, we see that the average <em>number of complaints</em> involving law enforcement do not follow the same pattern. Although you’ll notice that in Haywood (that’d be rural score = 4) complaints averaged over 1 per survey response, which is notable given the distribution of responses across the other rural scores.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>For this particular metric (average number of statements regarding law enforcement per person), Haywood shines. When we compare Haywood on a county level, we find only New Hanover can begin to compete, with most other counties averaging fewer than 0.7 complaints per person.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-5"></span>
<img src="coocli_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="Haywood had 1.12 complaints per survey response on average. New Hanover was next with 1.02 complaints; all other counties had significantly fewer." width="672" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The connection between rurality and infractions by law enforcement officers is driven by the <em>outrageous</em> frequency of arrests and confiscations in Haywood. Nearly <em>half</em> of the 65 respondents from Haywood reported <em>either <em>confiscation of</em> or <em>arrest for</em></em> supplies they received legally from NCHRC. This is in fact the one thing separating Haywood from the other counties. Once these questions are removed from the analysis, no significant relationship with rurality remains.</p>
<p>After initial analysis linking rurality to arrest/confiscation, we combine the following three questions into a giant ‘or’ statement as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Law enforcement arrested me for my supplies … OR …</li>
<li>Law enforcement confiscated my supplies … OR …</li>
<li>Law enforcement confiscated my card</li>
</ul>
<p>Below we examine the proportion of folks who identified <em>any of those statements</em> across counties. We also examine the complement subset of Law enforcement questions (i.e. all law enforcement statements excluding the 3 statements above.) by rurality to conclude that any relationship between negative law enforcement encounters and rurality was driven solely by arrests/confiscations in Haywood.</p>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-6"></span>
<img src="coocli_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="Confiscations of and arrests for supplies legally obtained from NCHRC are extremely high in Haywood county, with nearly 50% of survey participants from Haywood reporting they have experienced at least one of these infractions." width="672" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>We also examine the complement subset of Law enforcement questions (i.e. all law enforcement statements excluding the 3 statements above.) by rurality to conclude that any relationship that appeared between negative law enforcement encounters and rurality was driven solely by arrests/confiscations in Haywood.</p>

<p>These are problems specific to Haywood, and we do not have sufficient data to claim a link with rurality on any broader scale. One thing seems clear - it doesn’t seem that Haywood PD are behaving this way out of <em>ignorance</em> - to the contrary, participants in Haywood <em>did not</em> report that officers were <em>not familiar</em> with NCHRC at any notable rate. That problem (officers’ proclaimed ignorance of NCHRC) is more frequent in New Hanover county, based on our analysis.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>In Conclusion, it seems inappropriate to attribute any difference in the law enforcement questions to rurality when it’s more clearly a problem with Haywood, and most specifically a problem with confiscation of/arrest for supplies.</p>
<p>With a more robust survey of participants, perhaps including more local measures of rurality (as opposed to a county-wide labeling approach), we might be able to learn more about how police departments differ in their handling of NCHRC participants.</p>
