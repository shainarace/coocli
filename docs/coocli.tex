This is a \emph{sample} book written in \textbf{Markdown}. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

The \textbf{bookdown} package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

\CommentTok{# or the development version}

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading \texttt{\#}.

The variable across the columns here is the \emph{sum} of the responses to the questions about law enforcement. To test the significance of this, we can use Kruskal-Wallis on the lawSum variable or consider a chi-square test on the binary attribute I(lawSum\textgreater0).

And for many reasons this is a good measurement of \emph{breadth} of a problem with law enforcement (a number not influenced by a ``few excessive complainers'').

The first row of this table gives us rationale to gather more data - as there does appear to be some linear relationship here but as we will see in the next section, that relationship disappears after the removal of a few key questions in Haywood county.

After initial analysis linking rurality to arrest/confiscation, we combine the following three questions into a giant `or' statement as follows

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Law enforcement arrested me for my supplies \ldots{} OR \ldots{}
\item
  Law enforcement confiscated my supplies \ldots{} OR \ldots{}
\item
  Law enforcement confiscated my card
\end{itemize}

Below we examine the proportion of folks who identified \emph{any of those statements} across counties. We also examine the complement subset of Law enforcement questions (i.e.~all law enforcement statements excluding the 3 statements above.) by rurality to conclude that any relationship between negative law enforcement encounters and rurality was driven solely by arrests/confiscations in Haywood.

With a more robust survey of participants, perhaps including more local measures of rurality (as opposed to a county-wide labeling approach), we might be able to learn more about how police departments differ in their education/training.

We lump substances into 5 groups, separating cocaine stimulants (powder, crack, speedball) from amphetamine stimulants (meth, adderall). We also separate MAT opioids from the other opioids. These groups create binary variables, giving no weight to those using multiple substances within a category. We have a fairly representative distribution of participants across the 5 groups, which are not mutually exclusive (someone can use MAT and stimulants for instance).
